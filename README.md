## Welcome To Pokemon Flatiron Edition

## How To Play

While the game is running you're constantly prompted yes or no for "Will you keep playing?". y inputs yes and n inputs no. As long as you keep pressing y the game will continue indefinitely. After you choose your first pokemon deciding what to do next is pretty straight forward. Use up/down arrows and enter to make your selections from the list. Most trainers have 6 pokemon so before you decide to fight it's best to catch at least 6 pokemon of your own. Once you catch 6 pokemon the rest are transferred to your pc, so you have to release another one of your pokemon before you can catch a new one.
